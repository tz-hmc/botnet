# Botnet
## Final project for CS181N

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a (very basic) botnet works and how a C2 server would operate.
The server is NodeJS and logs data to a MongoDB database.
The client is a Python script that has to be run on the victim machine.
  (How this script actually gets onto a machine with a Python interpreter or spreads -- not exactly covered by the scope of this project)

Only the most barebones functionality is implemented/
